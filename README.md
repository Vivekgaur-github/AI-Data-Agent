# AI Data Agent User Manual

Welcome to **AI Data Agent** â€“ your interactive tool to analyze business data with ease. This guide explains how to get started and use the application effectively.

## Overview

The AI Data Agent provides a chat-based interface to ask complex analytical questions about your business data. It returns insights and visualizations to help you understand trends and patterns. Key features include:

- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Ask questions and receive data-driven responses. See the chat interface in [ChatInterface.tsx](src/components/ChatInterface.tsx).
- **Data Visualization:** Visualize responses through charts and tables on the dashboard ([DataVisualizer.tsx](src/components/DataVisualizer.tsx)).
- **Instructions & Examples:** Find detailed usage instructions and example queries in the accordion section ([InstructionsAccordion.tsx](src/components/InstructionsAccordion.tsx)).
- **Responsive Design:** Seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Getting Started

## How to Use

1. **Ask a Business Question:**
